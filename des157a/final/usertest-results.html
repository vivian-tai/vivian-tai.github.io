            <h2>Observation 1: Nav Bar Correspondence</h2>
            <p>
                The most significant issue for users was how the nav bar was used to correspond to each image. Each dot is meant to take you to each image, but it doesn't come across obviously especially at the end since the buttons get stuck.
            </p>

            <h2>Observation 2: Logo Link</h2>
            <p>
                The link embedded in the logo image is not obvious to click on. There is only a slight grow on hover to indicate that the element is clickable, but there is no header or anything to make it obvious.
            </p>

            <h2>Observation 3: Nav Bar Indicator</h2>
            <p>
                When the image is clicked on and the overlay is closed, the nav bar dot is no longer highlighted. This can make it confusing when the user returns to the main screen.
            </p>

            <h2>Plan</h2>
            <p>
                I think the dot menu nav bar created more confusion rather than being helpful. I may end up scrapping it in favor of the horizontal scroll (that ended up being disabled somehow once I implemented the nav bar). I may end up exploring other ways to make the website more interactive.
