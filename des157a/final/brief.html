            <h2>Project Summary </h2>
            <p>
                I am updating the Every Picture (Studio 3) project to be more comprehensive and personal to myself and hopefully to the user as well!

                This website actually inspired my Studio 2 project! I fell in love with the warm neutral tones, organic shapes, and calming animations. The simplicity of the website draws attention to the beauty of each jewelry. When clicked on, the picture rotates into a product page, with a direct link to the shop website to purchase the product. Everything on the website feels deliberate and cohesive, with one action flowing to the next. Because this website is so different from traditional e-commerce websites, it is more memorable and meaningful. One drawback is because this website is so interactive, it has a loading page which may be a drawback to those who are impatient.

                This website is similar to the one above, with more geometric shapes and showcases one product at a time. Once again, I was drawn to the neutral colors and clean geometry of the website. The overlap of the product over the colored background with the drop shadow feels different than other product pages. I also like how there is a nav bar at the bottom so users can easily click through each item. The text color change and slight image movement on hover are pleasant surprises that delight the user. There aren’t actually any improvements that I can think of at the moment for this website.

            <h2> Project Goals </h2>
            <p>
                My goals for this project is to increase the functionality and make the website more of a personal story intertwined with a product page. I would like to include an opening animation, about page, and more unique stories or details behind each product if possible. It is rather similar to Comparison Project 1, since it did serve as inspiration for how I wanted my Every Picture project to function and look like. Comparison Project 2 is a bit different since each product is featured separately, but there is the similarity of PNG transparency of each product image to have a unique cut-out shape. The difference from both of these projects are the design elements, as I have a different color palette and typeface. In addition, much less complex in terms of the interactive elements!

            <h2> Design Strategies </h2>
            <p>
                My design will likely be identical to my existing project, with the light blue background with white and golden yellow accents, paired with a white serif font. It’s the color palette and typeface I came up with while designing the branding behind my small business. My logo, the yellow sun with the bird, will be located in the upper right corner of the page. There may be some animated clouds floating around as well. I would like the page to be soft and inviting, to introduce the user to my products through playful design. Each animation and transition will flow seamlessly into the next action.

            <h2> Interaction Strategies </h2>
            <p>
                Upon opening the page, there will be the sun logo peeking out from behind a white cloud. The logo will then travel to the upper left hand corner of the screen while the white cloud floats away. The scroll of the page is horizontal when the user vertically scrolls. It will then fade into the main product page. The user will be able to interact with the product gallery and the menu navigation bar so they are able to click to a specific product. Each product is a faded grayscale. When each product is hovered over, the image grows slightly and fades into color. When each product is clicked, an overlay will transition to the product in full color with details about the product (and a link to the product!). The logo will be clickable, leading to an about page that explains more about the story of my small business.

            <h2> Experience Goals </h2>
            <p>
                My goal is for the user to feel as relaxed and delighted as possible while interacting with the website, while also learning more about the personal story behind the shop and its products. I use the words “faded” or “fade into” a lot when describing the interactions, which I think is appropriate for the tone I want to set for the website. Most of the interactions will fade into each other, hopefully creating a seamless experience. I also hope the small graphics, such as the logo and cloud animations, will bring a small bit of whimsy and joy to the viewer, along with adding character to further reinforce the branding of the business.
