                <p>
                <br>
                This image is interesting to me because all of the items being photographed were handmade by myself. To someone who does not have the context, they would probably think it is just a product photo of some earrings and dishes. I still remember setting up the shot and thinking that the light blue of the earrings against the neutral shell background could convey the feel of an ocean. In terms of functionality, it also shows product sizing and usage, which is very important in e-commerce. 
                <br><br>
                The image relates to the topic of my collection because it is part of what I sell in my small business. I gathered my favorite photos and wanted to showcase them artistically. I want to add a dynamic feel to a product page, since shopping sites are usually static and have the same template.
                <br><br>
                My archive represents my creative and crafty side! I'm really proud of how far I've come and how much I've learned through owning a small business. It's been such a rewarding experience to do something I love, connecting with fellow makers, and being able to share it with people around the world.

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/(7.3) Crow 7 Blank.jpg" alt="girl in black" width="300" height="300">

                <br>
                This image is about a female figure dressed in a fashionable black outfit. The context is that it is an illustration from a series of black fashion outfits. The color scheme of the clothing and accessories is primarily black with white and silver accents. There is a silver crown on black hair, and white detailing on the bodice and sleeves. 
                <br><br>
                One of the really interesting aspects of the photo is the white detailing on the sleeves. Because it takes up a significant part of the entire canvas, it really stands out and draws the viewer in. I like how there is a combination of round swirls, paired with sharper accents like the diamond and other pointed shapes. There’s a nice juxtaposition throughout in all of the details, including around the neckline. 
                <br><br>
                The most obvious aspect of the image is that it is a character dressed in a black outfit. The most mysterious aspect is considering whether the person has a certain background or story.

            <p>
                This <a href="https://manifesto.androll.fr/">website</a> that I found was so fun to interact with. I've never seen a website designed in this way. The colors are black and white, with some flashing elements. There is a mix of handwritten lettering and quirky graphics.
                <br><br>
                Navigating through the website was a bit overstimulating at first. I quickly learned that there was a cord that I could follow as a path in order to navigate through the website. I love how they incorporated different actions, such as drawing on a shirt and being able to make your own music through a soundboard!
                <br><br>
                In terms of usability, this may not be the best website since there is quite a lot of content to navigate through scrolling in all directions. However, in terms of originality and interactivity, this website is fun to experience. Websites don't have to be boring!

            <h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The article “Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows ” by Naema Baskanderi details the recommended usage for assets that can either be a great solution or an irritating problem to the user. Modal windows are elements that remain on top of the main window.
                <br><br>
                Using modal windows can be beneficial when you need to alert the user about something important, to get their input, and display more information either in or out of context. Proper modal windows include some way of closing the modal, a useful title, clear buttons, an appropriate size and focus, and are the result of the user interaction.
                <br><br>
                Beware of using modal windows in mobile devices, as the size constraint of the device hinders the ability for modal elements to be used optimally. In addition, it is important to note accessibility of modal windows such as adding keyboard controls.

        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            In reading the article “Best practices for form design” by Salim Ansari, I learned many valuable concepts that I hadn’t thought of previously, and others that I could relate to as a frustrated user. As the title suggests, the article discusses best practices to increase the usability of a form. I began to think about the everyday forms that I fill out online: setting up an account, ordering items online, or applying for jobs.
            <br><br>
            One best practice I found particularly striking was regarding asking for sensitive information. If a phone number is an optional field, I will not input it. However, if there is an explanation for it, such as calling about a package delivery, I am more likely to enter my phone number.
            <br><br>
            A website form that I think exemplifies best practices is checking out via the <a href="https://www.target.com/">Target</a> mobile app. There are very few fields, and all of the action buttons are placed conveniently without the extra need to leave the form. There is also good use of color and font sizes to distinguish information from each other.
