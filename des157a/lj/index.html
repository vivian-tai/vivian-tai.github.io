        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            In reading the article “Best practices for form design” by Salim Ansari, I learned many valuable concepts that I hadn’t thought of previously, and others that I could relate to as a frustrated user. As the title suggests, the article discusses best practices to increase the usability of a form. I began to think about the everyday forms that I fill out online: setting up an account, ordering items online, or applying for jobs.
            <br><br>
            One best practice I found particularly striking was regarding asking for sensitive information. If a phone number is an optional field, I will not input it. However, if there is an explanation for it, such as calling about a package delivery, I am more likely to enter my phone number.
            <br><br>
            A website form that I think exemplifies best practices is checking out via the <a href="https://www.target.com/">Target</a> mobile app. There are very few fields, and all of the action buttons are placed conveniently without the extra need to leave the form. There is also good use of color and font sizes to distinguish information from each other.
